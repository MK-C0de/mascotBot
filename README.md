# mascotBot

## Summary:
mascotBot is a Discord bot for Delta Phi Lambda Sorority Inc., an asain-interest Greek lettered organization founded in 1998. mascotBot encourages active house members to use and participate in their chapter's Discord server by implementing a daily points function where users submit once per day to recieve a random amount of points. Moderators or leaders in the chapter can give points at their discretion, or use an hoursattended function to incentivize attending and working events. These points can be exchanged for tickets that increase in price as the individual purchases them. Tickets can be used externally for a raffel or any custom system.
